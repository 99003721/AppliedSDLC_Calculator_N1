# Requirements
The calculator build by us includes basic arithmetic functions, trignometric functions and exponential functions. It also consists of some other functions including power, log, antilog, permutation and combination functions.
## Introduction

We have attempted to build the software development cycle of a semi-engineering calculator. It includes the numerous high-level and low-level requirements of the various features involved in semi-engineering such as log, antilog, exponents roots and polynomial functions. It then explores about the various test cases that should be taken in consideration such that all requirements are taken care of. In the end, we build the codes that follow all the requirements and design efficiently as per them.
 
## Research

There are different types of calculators with respect to the cost and its features. It is plotted in the graph shown below which shows the range of calculators for highest cost and lowest feature and vice versa. The range we have chosen is for a medium range cost and feature. It is similar to a programmable scientific calculator. It will be more efficient for the multipurpose use.

# Cost of the Calculator 
* Our Calculator will sum around 800 Rs , having all neccesary features required for all students 
* Cost and features mainly focus on most of the important requirments we reasearched for a calculator.

# Features that are integrated in our project calculator are : 
* Will perform basic Addition,Subtraction,divison,Multiplication with validtaion
* Also it can perform long division approach with remainder and quotient as a result
* Addition of Hexa decimal number
* Calucaltion of GCD
* Basic Trigonometry operation like Sine,Cos,Tan
* perofrming the power function i.e calucalting the power of the number
* Integrated with operation like logrithimic and Antilog calculation
* Factorial of numbers and Exponential 
* Mean of the numbers
* Conversion of numbers


## Defining Our System

Our system is more or less semi advanced which basically able to do desirable calculations of daily basis from bottom to top level i.e. it includes every basic operations which eats lots of time in scheduled timings.
